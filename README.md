# weatherDashboard


## Creating a clean and responsive website for a professional portfolio.

-My motivation was to create code to allow a user to check weather in multiple cities and see not only their search history but also the weather for the next 5 days.
-I built this project so that I could learn how to create a dynamic website that would pull information via APIs and display it.
-The problem that I solved were the display of data searched for in a separate website in a clean and responsive manner.
-I learned about APIs and how to display them properly.
